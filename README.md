# Rag Assistant ðŸ¤–ðŸ›    
RAG application with contextual retrieval. Targeted to agriculture needs.

# Context ðŸ—º    
This solution is built to help small business owners providing customer support for their solutions.     

With this tool business owner will be partially relieved of the task of answer to common user questions that could be solved by just reading the manual.     

As is, this solution has nothing to do necesary with agriculture specifically, and code will be as general as posible. 

Yet this development is relevant as it will grow targeting the needs of the agriculture users that arise.
